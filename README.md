## What's This Built With?

I'm a huge fan of Nextjs so I'm going with my tried and true.

But I am throwing in a new wrinkle... Tailwindcss.

It's someting I want to learn. 

Not sure why, but I love to learn so why not?

#### Greensock 

I am into animations and after trying a few different libraries... I love Greensock the most.

It is a giant pain to use it with React but to me it makes the most sense and I love the control it gives.
